# Towerdefence project for university course.
Project done using Scala and ScalaFX.

## Intallation
Recomendation is to use Oracles' Java jdk and compile project using Sbt. Other Java versions (At least openjdk 8) does not have javafx that is required.

## Requirements:
* Scalafx version 8.0.192-R14, notice that requires javafx, which Java openjdk does not hava but oracles' java jdk does. ScalaFX caused problems due to openjdk not having javafx and installing javafx packet did not solve situation and required using older version of javafx from the Ubuntu packet manager.
* play-json 2.6.9 and its subrequirements.
